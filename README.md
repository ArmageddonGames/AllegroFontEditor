# AllegroFontEditor (FontEd)

**Allegro Font Editor** (*a.k.a. `FontEd`) is a simple bitmap editor specialised for editing bitmap fonts for `Allegro 4.xx`. You can use it to create monochrome or coloured fonts from scratch or you can convert existing fonts into the font format used by the Grabber tool. Supports a lot of font formats including bitmap, BIOS, GRX, True Type and Type1 fonts. Source code is included.

This version of `FontEd` is for ``Allegro 4``, anf future builds of it via this fork will continue to be for **Allegro 4.xx**.

# Scope
We plan to either update **Allegro Font Editor** (`FontEd`) to use the most current version of `Allegro 4.x`, either as a standalone utility bundled with ZQuest (https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic), or to or to integrate the capabilities of FontEd for Allegro 4 into the Quest Editor software.
